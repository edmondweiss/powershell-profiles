# PowerShell Profiles
PowerShell Profiles is a repository containing PowerShell profiles which I use for different environments.

## Prerequisites
* The following scripts require PowerShell v5.1.

## Usage
The profiles scripts must renamed to _profile.ps1_ and be placed in the directory designated by the global PowerShell variable `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`.
